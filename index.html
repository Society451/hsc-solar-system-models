  <h1>Eudoxus of Cnidus and the Homocentric Sphere Model</h1>
  <section id="introduction">
    <p>
      Eudoxus' model of celestial motion, based on five principles, was an elegant solution to explaining planetary and stellar movement around a fixed, central Earth. 
      His model consisted of nested celestial spheres, each contributing to the observed motion of stars, planets, the sun, and the moon.

    <h2>Key Principles of Eudoxus' Model</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The Earth is the center of the universe.</li>
      <li>All celestial motion is circular and regular.</li>
      <li>The path and center of each celestial motion are the same as that of its motion.</li>
      <li>The center of all celestial motion is Earth.</li>
